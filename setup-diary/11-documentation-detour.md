### Documentation Detour: Setting up Git

- Might as well do this sooner rather than later

- Had to update my global git config to have the proper name and email

- Also, couldn't push for a minute from the command line...

  - I think it was because I hadn't actually committed this file yet

  - I ended up doing it all with VS Code, which was actually really easy

  - Turns out life is easiest working from a Unix system

  - Using GitHub in VS Code also probably helped, keeping it all in the family

- I also hadn't uploaded any SSH keys to my new Git account yet, which was as easy as copying my existing pub key into a settings window

- I can confirm that my issue with git on the command line was just because I hadn't added any files
