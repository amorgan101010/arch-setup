## Part 4. Refinement

### 2021-05-11

- Dishearteningly, I discovered yesterday that an official Arch Linux installer was released very recently :/

  - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3t3yqUvWSo>

- I'll want to install `tlp` for power management

  - I'll also want to configure it so it doesn't auto-power off USB devices

- UGH, I am trying out Solarized Light for a while and it is like looking at a negative

  - I am trying it out because it will be a bit easier to look at in sunlight, and I want to work outside!

- As for "refinements", I think I stand at the junction of many paths

- To most efficiently explore said maps, it would be prudent to start using VMs to test the install

  - The biggest advantage that will provide is the ability to create snapshots...why re-do all the other stuff if I just want to test the user script stuff?

  - Luckily, I figured out how to set up VirtualBox at some point in the past!

    - Eventually, that is the sort of finicky setup I'll want to document and automate for a possible future install

- It would also be nice to figure out how to create an ISO out of my installer...

  - I wonder if ISOs can be done in multiple layers, kinda like a Docker image

  - On that note, it would also be nice to get a Docker image of my install going!

- One last "path of convenience" is adding some flags to the installer scripts so far

  - At the very least, make the GUI optional

- I suppose adding the GUI flag has the best ratio

  - Ratio of what?

  - Hmm...usefulness/effort

    - A nice example was me falling down a rabbithole trying to figure out how to LaTeX that ratio up

      - Not terribly useful, would require learning how to do multiple things

      - ...that being said, it'd be pretty sick if I was able to easily embed LaTeX into my markdown

      - I wonder if BitBucket can render LaTeX? GitHub?

- Anyway; on to a gooey flag!

- Ideally at some point I will be able to actually re-do the install on my laptop

  - I don't want to lose my current install as a reference, but it is broken in subtle ways that a reinstall will likely remedy...

  - Now that my laptop has a usable battery, making it super pleasant to use is paramount!

- My brain is overflowing with tasks that need prioritizing

  - This leads to the metatask of needing to implement some sort of task management system

- I've dabbled in Task Warrior...and I know of a few other custom systems!

- Also, I think this particular repo's diary has outlived its usefulness for some tasks...I need a blog!
