### Driver Detour: Figure Out Bluetooth (and also audio setup (and maybe even Synaptic??))

- Figure out Bluetooth, somehow

  - This might come for free with a clean install of Gnome, I believe I cursed myself by DIYing it with my current install

- A related thing to work around in my current install is all my outdated and undocumented audio setup

  - I should probably redo that from scratch

    - It might be worth copying over my no-longer-existing audio software AUR packages, though
